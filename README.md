I'm a Senior React Developer with 5 years of experience building complex web applications, including payment processing platforms and BAAS services. With a Computer Science degree and expertise in React, Typescript, NextJS, Javascript, and various state management solutions, I create clean, high-quality code that scales. I thrive in fast-paced software house environments where I can tackle diverse projects and learn continuously. After successful roles in Brazil, I'm now seeking international opportunities to challenge myself and gain exposure to how larger companies approach development. I'm passionate about code quality, enjoy collaborative problem-solving, and have Advanced English communication skills.

Skills:
<ul>
  <li>Proficient in React, Typescript, Next, Redux e React Native</li>
  <li>Experienced in using popular UI libraries such as Material-UI, Tailwind, Styled Components and others</li>
  <li>Familiar with server-side rendering using Next.js</li>
  <li>Knowledgeable in version control using Git</li>

  <li>Strong problem-solving and debugging skills</li>
</ul>

Beyond my proficiency in React, I'm fervently diving into NodeJS to expand my expertise into full-stack development. I aim to seamlessly integrate React on the frontend with NodeJS on the backend, leveraging its power to create robust and scalable applications. My goal is to harness NodeJS's capabilities to ensure a cohesive and efficient user experience across the entire application.

Driven by an insatiable hunger for learning, I'm actively engaging with NodeJS, exploring its frameworks, and seeking mentorship opportunities to accelerate my growth. My aspiration is to architect end-to-end solutions that are both innovative and reliable, encompassing frontend and backend technologies for comprehensive web application development.
