I am a skilled React developer with 5 years of experience in building high-quality web applications. I have a strong understanding of React's core concepts and am adept at using various libraries and frameworks to create complex and dynamic user interfaces. I am a team player with excellent communication and problem-solving skills, and I am always eager to learn and grow my skill set.

Skills:
<ul>
  <li>Proficient in React, Typescript, Next, Redux e React Native</li>
  <li>Experienced in using popular UI libraries such as Material-UI, Tailwind, Styled Components and others</li>

Beyond my proficiency in React, I'm fervently diving into NodeJS to expand my expertise into full-stack development. I aim to seamlessly integrate React on the frontend with NodeJS on the backend, leveraging its power to create robust and scalable applications. My goal is to harness NodeJS's capabilities to ensure a cohesive and efficient user experience across the entire application.

Driven by an insatiable hunger for learning, I'm actively engaging with NodeJS, exploring its frameworks, and seeking mentorship opportunities to accelerate my growth. My aspiration is to architect end-to-end solutions that are both innovative and reliable, encompassing frontend and backend technologies for comprehensive web application development.
